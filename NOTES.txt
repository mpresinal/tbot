trading bot project:

To delete:
DefaultTradingAction
DefaultStrategy (BasedRuleStrategy replace DefaultStrategy)

to improve:
the BotActionStrategy should cache the strategy to avoid create new strategy for the same asset.

To add:
The boot need a strategy execution manager to manage the running strategy. 
Right now the bot does not have the option to stop a running strategy.

The boot need a component to monitor the profit ledger book. When a strategy
fail x time, I mean it is losing many time, the monitor component will notify 
to strategy execution manager that the strategy for the particular asset is not generating profit 
and it need to be shutdown. The bot will shutdown the strategy and will band the asset for some period of time,
it maybe days, hours, minutes, etc.
