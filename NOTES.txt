trading bot project:

To delete:
DefaultTradingAction....DONE!
DefaultStrategy (BasedRuleStrategy replace DefaultStrategy)...PENDING

to improve:
the BotActionStrategy should cache the strategy to avoid create new strategy for the same asset.
improve the way data is loaded from the market. At first time a bunch data is loaded, that's fine, but loading data for the same period in the same sesion
should not load previous data instead the most recent.

To add:
The boot need a strategy execution manager to manage the running strategy. 
Right now the bot does not have the option to stop a running strategy.

The boot need a component to monitor the profit ledger book. When a strategy
fail x time, I mean it is losing many time, the monitor component will notify 
to strategy execution manager that the strategy for the particular asset is not generating profit 
and it need to be shutdown. The bot will shutdown the strategy and will band the asset for some period of time,
it maybe days, hours, minutes, etc.


New indicators:
Add the pivot high low indicator

New Bot Actions: 
create a new action to identify char patterns like: triangle patttern (the pivot high low help to identify this type of pattern)
